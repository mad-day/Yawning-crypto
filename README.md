# Yawning-crypto

Stuff, mirrored from github.com/Yawning/* to remove the dead references to git.schwanenlied.me/yawning/* repos.

The code is (C) *Yawning Angel (yawning at schwanenlied dot me)*. I mirrored it, because the code in his github repos,
constantly import golang packages located at `git.schwanenlied.me/yawning/*` which down currently, and otherwise appeared to be unreliable somehow.

In these repo, you'll find code with working package-references.


## Disclaimer

*This is not done in an act of disrespect.* But if I find stuff, that's broken, I fix it. I was fed up by broken builds caused by

```go
import "git.schwanenlied.me/yawning/... .git/..."
```

and all that error messages because of that. My intention is to fix it.
